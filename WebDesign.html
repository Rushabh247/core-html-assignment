    <h2>Web Design</h2>
    <p>Web design primarily focuses on the aesthetic and user experience aspects of a website or web application. It involves creating the visual layout, typography, color schemes, and overall design elements to ensure an engaging and intuitive user experience. Web designers often use graphic design tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or Sketch to create mockups and prototypes of website designs. They also need to have a good understanding of principles such as typography, color theory, and user interface (UI) design.

        Additionally, web designers may need to be familiar with frontend technologies like HTML and CSS to effectively communicate their designs to developers. They work closely with frontend developers to ensure that the final product aligns with the envisioned design.
        
        In practice, web development and web design often overlap, especially in smaller teams or freelance settings where individuals may handle both aspects of creating a website. However, in larger organizations, there may be dedicated teams or individuals for each role, with collaboration being key to producing successful web projects. Both web development and web design are essential components of creating modern, functional, and visually appealing websites and web applications.</p>
