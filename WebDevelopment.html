<h2>Web Development</h2>

<p>Web development primarily deals with the technical aspects of building a website or web application. It involves writing code to create the functionality of a website, such as user authentication, database interactions, and dynamic content generation. Web development is typically divided into two main categories</p>

 <h3>Frontend Development:</h3>
 <p> Frontend development involves creating the user interface and experience of a website. Frontend developers use languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and implement the visual elements and interactivity of web pages. They also work with frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js to streamline development and enhance user experience.</p>

<h3>Backend Development:</h3>
<p> Backend development focuses on the server-side logic and database interactions of a website or web application. Backend developers use languages like Python, JavaScript (Node.js), Ruby, PHP, or Java to build the server-side components. They also work with databases (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store and retrieve data, and frameworks like Django, Flask, Express.js, or Ruby on Rails to expedite development.</p>
